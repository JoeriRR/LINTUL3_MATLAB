# LINTUL3_MATLAB
LINTUL3 crop model in MATLAB obtained from Wagingen University. The FORTRAN code inside the FST-simulator has been transferred to MATLAB code (LINTUL3.m/LINTUL3_onestage.m). This MATLAB code is compared with the original FORTRAN code in LINTUL3_res.m, which uses the file 'res.dat' as input. The weatherfiles for Amersfoort that are used for input can be found in the ICWEATHER directory. Results from the DHMARA optimization can be found in the Results directory. Figures which are saved in the GUI are saved in the directory Figures.
